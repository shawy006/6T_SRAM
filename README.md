### **SRAM Array Overview**

#### 1. **SRAM Cells** (Orange Blocks)
- Each orange block represents a **single SRAM cell** storing one bit (0 or 1).
- This 8x6 array consists of 48 cells arranged in 8 rows and 6 columns.
- Rows and columns are accessed through **wordlines** and **bitlines**, respectively, to read or write data.

#### 2. **Wordlines** (Horizontal Red Lines)
- **Wordlines** control each row and run horizontally across the array.
- Activating a wordline enables the row, allowing data to be accessed.

#### 3. **Bitlines** (Vertical Blue Lines)
- **Bitlines** run vertically along each column, with each cell having two (BL and BL-bar) for differential transmission.
- During read/write operations, bitlines transfer data to/from selected cells.

#### 4. **Address Decoder** (Left Side)
- The **3-bit address decoder** selects specific rows, activating one wordline at a time.
- This setup supports addressing across all 8 rows of the SRAM array.

#### 5. **Data Input (Data In)** (Top Left Corner)
- The **Data In** lines allow up to 6 bits to be written to one row simultaneously.
- These bits are driven onto the bitlines and written to SRAM cells when the row is activated.

#### 6. **Sense Amplifiers** (Bottom of Each Column)
- **Sense amplifiers** connected to bitlines detect and amplify voltage differences during read operations.
- These signals are then routed to the **Data Out** lines.

#### 7. **Data Output (Data Out)** (Bottom Center)
- The **Data Out** lines deliver data read from the selected row, allowing simultaneous read of 6 bits.

### **How the SRAM Array Works**

#### Writing Data
1. The **address decoder** activates the desired wordline.
2. Bitline data (`1` or `0`) is written to cells by enabling access transistors.
3. Deactivation of the wordline isolates the bitlines from the SRAM cells, completing the write.

#### Reading Data
1. The address decoder activates the wordline for the desired row.
2. The selected SRAM cells place their values on the bitlines.
3. **Sense amplifiers** amplify the bitline voltages and pass them to the Data Out lines.

### **Key Components**

#### 1. **6T SRAM Cell**
- Consists of **6 transistors**: 2 cross-coupled inverters store the bit, and 2 access transistors enable read/write.
- The cell retains data (0 or 1) as long as power is supplied.

#### 2. **Write Operation**
- Data on the bitline (high or low) is written to the cell when the wordline is activated.
- Precise timing and voltage control are critical to avoid data corruption.

#### 3. **Read Operation**
- The wordline enables access transistors, connecting stored data to the bitline.
- A **sense amplifier** detects and amplifies the voltage, providing a clean output.

#### 4. **Sense Amplifier**
- Amplifies small differential voltages between BL and BL-bar during reads.
- Typically consists of cross-coupled inverters or high-gain circuits.

#### 5. **TSMC 180nm CMOS Technology**
- Defines transistor characteristics (size, voltage) for the design.
- Chosen for its reliability and cost-effectiveness in low-power applications.

### **Operation of a 6T SRAM Cell**

#### Write Operation

- **Write 1:** Set wordline high, bitline high, and bitline bar low. Data `1` is stored.
- **Write 0:** Set wordline high, bitline low, and bitline bar high. Data `0` is stored.
  The **write operation** involves storing a bit (either 0 or 1) into the SRAM cell. To perform this operation, the **word line** (WL) and **bit line** (BL) are manipulated.

#### **Write 1 (Store Logic High)**:
1. **Word Line (WL)** is activated (set high). This turns on the **access transistors (M1 and M2)**, connecting the storage nodes to the bit lines.
2. To write a `1` into the cell:
   - Set **bit line (BL)** high (`1`), while the **bit line bar (BLB)** stays low (`0`).
   - The high voltage on the bit line (BL) forces the **upper storage node** (the gate of the PMOS transistor in the inverter) to be high, setting it to `1`.
   - The low voltage on the **bit line bar (BLB)** pulls the **lower storage node** (the gate of the NMOS transistor in the inverter) to `0`, ensuring the cell stores a `1` at the upper storage node and `0` at the lower node.

3. After the write is completed, the **word line (WL)** is deactivated, and the access transistors turn off, isolating the bit lines from the SRAM cell. The cell now holds a `1`.

#### **Write 0 (Store Logic Low)**:
1. **Word Line (WL)** is activated (set high), connecting the storage nodes to the bit lines.
2. To write a `0` into the cell:
   - Set **bit line (BL)** low (`0`), while the **bit line bar (BLB)** is high (`1`).
   - The low voltage on the bit line forces the **upper storage node** to be low (`0`), and the high voltage on the bit line bar pulls the **lower storage node** high (`1`), ensuring the cell stores a `0`.

3. Once the write operation completes, the **word line (WL)** is deactivated, and the access transistors turn off, isolating the bit lines.

#### Read Operation

1. Activate wordline to connect bitline with storage nodes.
2. Stored bit voltage affects bitline, detected and amplified by sense amplifier.
3. Sense amplifier provides a clear output based on bitline data.
   
### **2. Read Operation**

The **read operation** retrieves the data stored in the SRAM cell (either a `1` or a `0`) and places it on the bit line for further processing.

#### **Read Process:**
1. **Word Line (WL)** is activated (set high). This connects the storage nodes to the bit lines via the **access transistors (M1 and M2)**.
2. The data stored in the cell (either `1` or `0`) determines the behavior on the bit lines.
   - If the stored data is `1`, the **upper storage node** is high, and the **lower storage node** is low. As the **bit line** is connected to the high storage node, it will tend to pull the bit line high.
   - If the stored data is `0`, the **upper storage node** is low, and the **lower storage node** is high. The **bit line** is pulled low by the low voltage stored at the upper node.
3. The voltage difference between the **bit line** and **bit line bar (BLB)**, created by the state of the cell, is small but enough to be sensed and amplified.
